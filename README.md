# 📘 Exam Seating Management System

A complete Spring Boot based web application designed to automate and manage college examination seating arrangements with authentication, room allocation, and student seat lookup.

---

## 🧠 Introduction

Managing exam seating manually is error‑prone, time‑consuming, and stressful during real examinations.
This project provides a centralized system where admins can generate seating plans and students can instantly check their room and seat using their register number.

The system also integrates authentication and role‑based access control for **Admin, Staff, and Students**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Automate exam seating arrangement
* Avoid adjacent same‑subject students (anti‑copy strategy)
* Allow students to check seat instantly
* Reduce manual workload for exam coordinators
* Provide scalable architecture for thousands of students
* Provide secure login using role‑based authorization
* Maintain history and logs of seat allocation

---

## ❓ Why I Built This Project

In colleges, exam seating is usually done in Excel sheets or manually, which causes:

* Human errors
* Duplicate seating
* Adjacent same department students
* Last minute confusion
* Heavy workload for faculty

So I built a system that:

* Automatically distributes students
* Follows anti‑malpractice seating rules
* Is fast enough for thousands of lookups
* Works like a real university system

---

## 💡 Solution Provided

This system solves the problem using:

* Bucket‑based seating algorithm
* Session wise shuffling
* Bench distribution logic (L, M, R)
* Anti‑adjacency checker
* Fast lookup using caching approach
* Role‑based authentication

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Modules

#### Auth Module (coe_auth)

* Login & Registration
* Roles & Permissions
* JWT Security
* Room Access Management

#### Exam Seating Module

* Room Management
* Student Session Mapping
* Seat Allocation Engine
* Seating History
* Student Seat Lookup

---

## 🧮 Seating Allocation Approach

### Case 1 — 3 or More Sessions

Students distributed alternately per bench:

Bench: `[L, M, R]`

* L → DAA
* M → ENG
* R → DLD

Next bench repeats in rotation.
If one session finishes → next session bucket replaces it.

---

### Case 2 — 2 Sessions

Middle seat kept empty:

* L → DAA
* M → EMPTY
* R → DLD

---

### Case 3 — 1 Session

Two students per bench:

* L → Student
* M → EMPTY
* R → Student

## 🔎 Student Seat Lookup Flow

1. Student enters Register Number
2. System checks cache / DB
3. Returns:

   * Room Number
   * Bench Number
   * Seat Position (L/M/R)
   * Session
